# TwinCATErrorTrack
Finds and log to persistent memory application Errors

It's not uncommon to make mistakes when coding, for example:
Divison by zero
Checkbounds and so on

As well as other error that might happen, such as:
Perfomance issues (a giant loop running on the code which may cause exceed counter and so on)
EtherCAT intermittent errors that occur only when a particular situation happens (cable problems and so on)

Sometimes it's very difficult to find what's the root cause of the problem, specially when it happens only on a particular condition
It may happen that only once a week a certain condition is met, so if the programmer of the system is not there to see it's impossible to say what exactly happened
That's the kind of issue that this software adresses: log it to the persistent memory
